A copy of the game pong that every programmer should try to replicate if they want to make games! Code is probably messy but everything works fairly well. 

Known issues that need tweaking:
1. AI tracks the y-position of the ball, needs to be able to predict where the ball will be when it reaches its end.
2. Need to change the dynamics of the physics when the ball hits the ball, right now it simply reverses the x-velocity and speeds up the      y-velocity to keep things interesting.
3. Possible moving functions around so their location makes more sense?
4. Some functions have so many parameters and looks messy to me.
5. Not quite sure if using "pass by double pointer" and "pass by pointer reference" is being used correctly.
6. The paths for loading up images and sounds are too specific.
7. Should I upload the images and sounds effects I used for my game to github?
